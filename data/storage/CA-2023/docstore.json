In 2023, the Company held courses related to reservations, tariffs and \nticketing for external associates, employees of IATA travel agencies and young people \nlooking to better position themselves in the labour market.  \nThe training process for Croatia Airlines\u2019 employees relies primarily on internal resources, \nimplying the use of its own authorised instructors.

The Company\u2019s seat charging offer has been expanded \nthrough the i mplementation of the Chargeable Seat service with the Global Distribution \nSystem \u2013 Sabre.  \nIn order to offer an even better and more complete service, Croatia Airlines is introducing \nseat selection at a fee on its partners\u2019 flights as well. In April, it implemented iEMD6, \ninterline seat charging, with LH Group . It activated Interline Electronic Ticketing with its \npartners  Air Dolomiti (in early June), EW Discover (in early September), and  Deutsche \nBahn (in the second half of September) , thus expanding its service to rail travels to certain \ndestinations in Germany, as well as to Brussels, Amsterdam and Zurich . IET with the \npartner Flydubai is in the final stage, and should be implemented by the end of January \n2024. Upon exchanging documentation and completing the tests on the level of service \nproviders in November 2023, IET is expected to be tested with the par tner APG Connect \nas well. APG Connect is a distribution system for IET, intended f or IATA and non -IATA \ntravel agencies as a platform for issuing, changing and refunding airline tickets for more \nthan 100 companies world -wide. Moreover, the Company is testing the STAR Cross Sell \nof Seats  with its partner United Airlines, which will enable it to sell seats within the interline \nscenario as well .  \nCroatia Airlines also intensified activities within the project of charging baggage through \nthe Departure Control System (DCS), making it possible to charge excessive carry -on \nbaggage (in terms of number or weight) straight at the gate.  \nAs part of its partner cooperation with Europcar, since June 2023 Croatia Airlines has \nbeen offering its passengers a car rental booking service via a link on its website, thus \nunifying both services in one place. In cooperation with Amadeus, the same serv ice was \nimplemented in November 2023 on the Confirmations  page and My bookings page .  \nDuring the year, Croatia Airlines carried out preparations for ISO 27001 certification. The \nproject\u2019s aim is to bring the safety of the IT system (organisational and technological \nmeasures) in compliance with the requirements of ISO 27001 and verify the co mpliance \nthrough the certification process. An information security management system compliant \nwith ISO/IEC 27001 helps organisations manage the security of their resources, such as \nfinancial information, intellectual property, employee data or third part y information.

Therefore, taking into account all factors of civil \naviation, the forecasts of economic growth serve as the basic \npresumptions for the drawing up of business and development plans. In 2023, the global \neconomy continued to be confronted with enormous challenges resulting from Russia\u2019s \ninvasion of Ukraine and the soaring cost of living caused by ever -growing inflationary \npressures. The intertwining crises led to an economic growth slow down due to the \naggravating consequences of the war in Ukraine, supply chain disruptions, energy crisis, \nand high inflation. An escalation of war in Israel  in the final quarter of 2023 and its possible \nspreading to the surrounding countries is an additional threat.  \nIn its October outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed out mitigated \nfinancial risks and a gradual recovery from the pandemic crisis and the consequences of \nthe war in Ukraine. Global economy should see a 3.0% growth in 2023, 0.2 pp up from \nthe IMF's forecast released in April.7 In 2022, global economy recorded a 3.5% growth. \nInflation should gradually let up owing to declining food and energy prices, although at a \nslower pace than initially expected, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023.  \nThe resolution of the dispute over the increase of the U.S. debt ceiling and strict \ngovernmental measures taken in the first half of the year, which mitigated disruptions in \nthe USA and the Swiss banking sector, reduced the risk of turmoil and slowdown in global \neconomic growth. However, the main risks to the global growth remain high. Inflation \ncould remain high or even rise further if new shocks should occur, including those \nstemming from intensified war operations in Ukraine and extreme weather, which \nnecessitates more restrictive monetary policies. Achieving sustainable disinflation while \nensuring financial stability remains a priority in most economies.  \nThe IMF puts the U.S. economy growth at 2.1% in 2023, and that of China at 5.0%. \nGrowth for the eurozone is estimated at 0.7% only, with the emerging markets and \ndeveloping economies expected to expand by 2.4% .  \n \nAccording to the IMF\u2019s outlook by countries released in October \n2023, Croatia\u2019s economy should expand 2.7% in 2023.  \nThe country\u2019s inflation is seen to reach 8.6% in 2023, \nunemployment rate is estimated at 6.3%, and the current account balance will record a \ndeficit of 0.2% of GDP.  \nAccording to the first estimates of the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, Croatia\u2019s real GDP \nrose by 2.8% in 2023 year -on-year.8  \nThe calendar -adjusted data say that Croatia's industrial production in 2023 declined by \n0.9% compared to 2022.9 Its real retail trade increased by 3.7% compared to 2022.10 \n \n7 IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 2023  \n8 www.dzs.hr/  Release: First estimate of quarterly gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 2023, 1 \nMarch 2024  \n9 www.dzs.hr/  Release: Industrial production volume index and indices of stocks, persons employed and \nlabour productivity in industry, in December 2023, 12 February 2024  \n10 www.dzs.hr/ Release: Retail trade in December 2023, 12 February 2024  Global economy  \nCroatia\u2019 s economy", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5, "end_char_idx": 3349, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cd07ea9-4cc5-4f78-a548-71046d79d418": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cd07ea9-4cc5-4f78-a548-71046d79d418", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7638903f-1c3e-4e99-ac3e-43624a8a9c64", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "2f847c30f595657fe99fd6b90bda1e1dd7162637df598686215733298412ab8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The M anagement\u2019 s Business Report for 2023  \n21 \n \nConsumer price inflation accelerated gradually in 2023 , and the inflation rate in Croatia \naveraged 4.5% in 2023.11  \nAccording to the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, the number of persons in employment rose \nby 1.3% compared to 2022, and Croatia\u2019s registered unemployment rate was 6.5% in \nDecember 2023 (8.6% in December 2022).12  \nThe first results published by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics say that the country\u2019s \nforeign trade deficit reached EUR 16.5 billion in 2023, with the total value of exports being \nEUR 22.8 billion, and of imports EUR 39.4 billion.

The biggest external risks affecting \nCroatia Airlines\u2019 business operations are: economic surroundings (Croatia and \ndestinations), competition, Star Alliance and partnerships, risks related to price ch anges \n(traffic charges and flight permits, suppliers, fuel, emission allowances), movements of \ncurrencies, interest rates, etc. The biggest internal risks include human resources, \ncapacity management, operational disturbances, sales, revenue management, an d \nliquidity risk, especially in the winter months.  \nAlthough the air traffic scope has not yet reached the levels recorded in the pre -crisis year \nof 2019, it is picking up and should return to the pre -pandemic level in 2024. The business \noperations of air carriers in 2023 were exposed to a number of major r isks, and keeping \nthe balance between various factors and responses to individual risks became more \ncomplicated. Fuel and emission allowance prices, and inflation, were the main risks that \naffected Croatia Airlines\u2019 operations in 2023, while a strong incre ase in sales revenue and \na stable cash balance level reduced the liquidity risk. Along with mitigating potential \nnegative consequences of these risks, Croatia Airlines was focused on further \nimplementation of its Post -COVID Strategy.  \n \nCroatia Airlines\u2019 increased block time by 11% and fuel \nprocurement by 12% in 2023 year -on-year; however, the costs \nwere 12% lower compared to the same period.

The implementation of the Fit for 55 package through \nReFuelEU represents a new challenge for European airlines, since starting from 1 \nJanuary 2026 they will no longer be entitled to free emission allowances, and will be \nobligated to purchase SAF (sustainable aviation fuels) as of 1 January 2025 and start to \nmonitor NOx and So 2 emissions in addition to CO 2. The aggravating circumstance for the \nCroatian market is the fact that the Republic of Croatia will not be producing SAF in the \ncountry for the time being, as the project will be implemented on the level of MOL Group. \nThere is a scarcity of SAF for import , and a lack thereof on both the European and global \nmarkets. What worries is the fact that feedstock for SAF production has to b e imported to \nthe EU.  \nCroatia Airlines continues with relevant preparations and adjustments related to supply \nand introduction of novelties in cooperation with all market stakeholders, being aware of \nthe fact that emission allowances in both the primary and secondary markets ar e \nexceptionally prone to volatility.

Operating costs of all categories, except for flight and depreciation costs,  saw a \nrise. Maintenance costs recorded the highest growth (+37%), as a result of increased \nblock time and the aging fleet, but also due to the higher prices of services and materials \nrelated to aircraft maintenance. Increa sed block time and unit prices of the services of \ncertain suppliers led to greater costs of air traffic services, i.e. airport and air traffic control \nservices. Promotion and sales costs, and passenger service costs also recorded a rise \namidst a greater nu mber of passengers. The Company\u2019s general and administrative costs \nrose primarily as a result of greater current maintenance costs, while other expenditure \nsaw an increase mostly due to greater costs in the preceding years and capital \nexpenditures.  \nDespite increased block time, flight costs were somewhat lower, due to significantly lower \njet fuel prices ( -17%) in 2023 compared to 2022. Depreciation costs were lower as a result \nof regular monthly write -offs and a lower level of investments.  \n \nIn addition to the growth of overall \ncost levels compared to 2022, the \ncosts  structure also noticeably \nchanged84 \u2013 in favour of aircraft \nmaintenance costs, the share of \nwhich rose by 3 pp as a result of \nan increase in block time and unit \nprices of services.

The crisis  had a \nparticularly devastating effect on tourism and travels, with airline companies and air traffic \nin general being among the most affected sectors. A gradual recovery of the aviation \nindustry began in 2022 and continued in 2023, but the traffic level o f 2019 has not been \nreached yet.  \nFollowing the airline industry recovery and trends, Croatia Airlines kept increasing \nfrequencies and reintroducing certain routes in 2023, which led to an 11% increase in \nblock time, i.e. number of flights, and a 19% rise in passenger numbers compared to \n2022. The 2019 results are expected to be reached in 2024.  \nThe business operations of air carriers in 2023 were exposed to a number of major risks, \nand keeping the balance between various factors and responses to individual risks \nbecame more complicated. Fuel and emission allowance prices, and inflation, were the \nmain risks that affected Croatia Airlines\u2019 operations in 2023, while a strong increase in \nsales revenue and a stable cash balance level reduced the liquidity risk. To mitigate the \nrisk of allowance price volatility, the Company purchased allowances for 202 3 in \nNovember and December 2023 at a significantly lower price compared to that in April, \nwhen it had purchased allowances for 2022. In addition to these long -term risks, labour \nshortage in all segments of air traffic presented a great challenge for the ai rline industry \nin 2023. Croatia Airlines had enough operative transport staff in the summer season of \n2023, but the big problems at major European airports caused by the shortage of staff, \nmainly air traffic controllers, represented a risk for the Company and led to traffic \ndisruptions and related costs, especially in the summer season . The risk was decreased \nin the winter season, given the reduced traffic scope at airports. One of the risks is the \nescalation of conflicts in Israel and in the Middle East, as it affects charter flights operated \nby Croatia Airlines between Croatia and Isr ael. This market is particularly important since \nit enables night utilisation of aircraft that would otherwise be left parked. The continuation \nof conflicts would negatively a ffect the year of 2024, as some 60 to 80 aircraft rotations \n(360 to 480 block hours) a year have been planned, mostly from Zagreb, and to a smaller \nextent from Dubrovnik to Tel Aviv.  \nDespite a whole array of growing risks, significant positive shifts were made compared to \n2022, both in terms of traffic growth and financial operations.  \nAlong with mitigating potential negative consequences of these risks, Croatia Airlines will \nfocus on further implementation of its Post -COVID Strategy.  \nWith the aim of creating an even better -quality and more competitive air transport offer in \nthe Republic of Croatia, in early October 2022 Croatia Airlines reached a decision to start \nwith a fleet renewal process, i.e. to replace its existing aircraft with  a new, uniform fleet, \nall in line with its Post -COVID Strategy adopted in August 2021. With a single -type aircraft \nfleet, Croatia Airlines will simplify its processes and improve its operating and financial \nresults. It will become even more environmentall y-friendly and significantly reduce fuel \nconsumption and CO 2 emissions, the costs of which are a major expenditure item. In \n2023, the Company intensified activities related to the procurement and introduction of \nthe first new A220 aircraft into the fleet as of 2024, in line with Croatia Airlines\u2019 Post -\nCOVID Strategy.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5, "end_char_idx": 3866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe7b1482-b1ec-41cd-91c4-ef0b0f9e7092": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe7b1482-b1ec-41cd-91c4-ef0b0f9e7092", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0db02c1c-52f6-45c9-8596-82a81edce54d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "fc416b67672294160d89b9954c9d0c14804a6ac9ce5f6ba1442d3ddc7a8ca531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The M anagement\u2019 s Business Report for 2023  \n42 \n \nSince 2022, Croatia Airlines\u2019 business plans have been based on the Post -COVID \nStrategy initiatives that would ensure long -term sustainability of operations, while defining \nthe strategic goals and measures to achieve them.  \nKey strategic goals:  \n1) Profitability;  \n2) Responsibility to shareholders;  \n3) Capital increase;  \n4) Fleet renewal and optimisation;  \n5) Implementation of the PSO contract.  \n \nIn order to achieve the above strategic goals, the Company will initiate, or has already \ninitiated, the following measures:  \n \n1) Fleet structure optimisation  \nIn addition to post -COVID recovery of operations, one of the key goals of the Business \nPlan is replacement of the existing fleet with newer and more cost -effective aircraft, via \noperating lease. After a detailed analysis of the airline market and aircraft offer, Croatia \nAirlines opted for A220 type aircraft, with the capacity of 149 (A220 -300) and 127 seats \n(A220 -100), to be delivered in the period from 2024 to 2027.  \nIn early 2023, it entered into an operating lease contract for six Airbus A220 (four A220 -\n300 and two A220 -100) with Air Lease Corporation. On 30 October 2023, it finalised \narrangements for an operating lease of three Airbus A220 with lessor Azzora. In the  \nsecond half of December 2023, it arranged for the financing of six A220 with Griffin Global \nAsset Management. The six aircraft were ordered directly from Airbus, as part of an annex \nto the contract dating from 2008. The financing refers to prepayments and  operating lease \nof the six aircraft. This way it arranged for the procurement of 15 Airbus A220 aircraft, as \nenvisaged by the Post -COVID Strategy.  \nA potential delay in delivery of new aircraft and adequate disposal of the five Company -\nowned Airbus 319/320 upon expiry of their service life are seen as two major risks within \nthe fleet replacement process. The decommissioning of the Airbus fleet requires a \nsolution to be found while the aircraft are still airworthy, so that their engines, parts and \ncomponents could be monetised. Selling them in bulk and in \u2018as is\u2019 condition, through \nsale and leaseback, is se en as the most cost -effective option, which imp lies selling them \nwhile they are still airworthy and at the same time keeping a lease on them until they are \nreplaced with new ones. The advantage of this approach is ensuring the flexibility needed \nwhen implementing the fleet renewal plan (e.g. extending the lease period in case of \ndelayed deliveries of new aircraft), while transferring the risks related to the disposal of \nnon-airworthy aircraft to the lessor . In September 2023, the Company effected the sale \nand leaseback of the Airbus 319/320, and related  funds will be used for the purchase of \nspare engines for the A220 fleet. The other aircraft (the Dash 8 -Q400 fleet) will be \nreturned to their owners/lessors upon expiry of the lease period .  \n \n2) Optimisation and expansion of the destinations network   \nIn line with the expected recovery of demand for air traffic services upon completion of \nthe pandemic, the Plan envisages a gradual increase in the number of destinations and \nfrequencies, and optimisation of the expanded destinations network. In 2022, the \nCompany introduced five new international routes from Split Airport: to Amsterdam, \nBucharest, Dublin, Milan and Stockholm, and increased block time in the winter period by", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5, "end_char_idx": 3469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32cf22bb-8f79-4b65-8190-22ace4d6521f": {"__data__": {"id_": "32cf22bb-8f79-4b65-8190-22ace4d6521f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "38191405-3b1d-4ae5-bd20-be84559bbad9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "5866046fa847b3d1b855e2c24359475b02104a13d1c2ac5355b8104274777dc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The M anagement\u2019 s Business Report for 2023  \n43 \n \nintroducing the Osijek -Munich, Split -Zurich, and Pula -Zurich routes.

One of the initiatives is to reduce labour costs by implementing \ncrew scheduling optimisation measures and increasing the productivity of technical, \ncommercial and administrative staff through business process optimisation. Due to \ngrowing prices, inflationary pressures and unit price increases announced by suppliers, \nthe effect of these measures were significantly lower than that envisaged by the Post -\nCOVID Strategy, particularly in 2023 . In order to further optimise costs by optimising its \nbusiness processes, the Company started with digitalisation in th e commercial segment, \nin particular aircraft maintenance process. The company -wide DMS (Document \nManagement Systems) project is set to begin in 2024.  \n7) Negotiations with Airbus with respect to A320neo order cancellation  \nThe negotiations about the termination/amendment to the 2008 contract with Airbus \nIndustrie for the procurement of four A320neo aircraft started in the autumn of 2019. The \nnegotiations on the Termination Agreement the subject -matter of which is cancelling the \nacquisition of A320neo aircraft were put on hold at the onset of the COVID -19 crisis, and \nresumed in early 2021. In 2022, within the negotiations with Airbus on the order of six \nnew A220 aircraft, the parties came to an agreement that this order would replace the \norder of A320neo aircraft, within Croatia Airlines' fleet renewal project and in line with the \nPost-COVID Strategy stipulations. So, instead of negotiating the termination of the old \ncontract, an annex was added to the purchase contract from Ap ril 2008 by way of which \nthe existing obligations related to A320neo aircraft were replaced with a new one, \nreferring to the purchase of six A220 aircraft.

Until the passenger coupons \nare used, the value  of the sold flight documents is \nrecognized in short -term liabilities from air traffic, \nwhich are reduced after the performance of the \ntransportation service or by refunding the \nappropriate amount to the passenger for returned \ntickets.    \nDue to the Company's business model, the \ndetermination of the amount of revenue recognized \nin the period, i.e. the precise recognition of \nrevenue in the Statement of Comprehensive Income \naccording to the International Financial Reporting \nStandard \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" \n(IFRS 15), is based on complex internal IT systems \nwithin which a large number of transactions are \nprocessed.  \nConsidering the significance of the sales revenue \nshown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, \nalong with the complexity of the IT system, we \nconcluded that the stability, accuracy and \ncompleteness of the revenue, as well as their \nrecording in the corre ct reporting period, is a key \naudit matter.  \n \nSee Notes 2.a) \"Revenues\" and 4. \"Revenues from \npassenger traffic\" in the corresponding annual \nfinancial statements.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  \nConsolidation basis  \nThe enclosed consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and the entities under \nits control, i.e. its subsidiaries, including the structured entities. Control is achieved when the Company has the following : \n\u2022 power over the entity;  \n\u2022 exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and  \n\u2022 the ability to use its power over the entity to affect its returns.  \nThe Company and the Group reassess the control status if there are any changes in the facts and circumstances that affect \none or more of the three elements of control described above. In the event that the Company holds less than the majority \nof voting rig hts in an entity, it is deemed to have power over that entity if its voting rights are sufficient to enable it to \ndirect the entity\u2019s essential activities.  \nIn determining whether its voting rights in the entity are sufficient to exert power, the Company considers all relevant \nfacts and circumstances, including:  \n\u2022 the proportion of its voting rights in relation to the size and distribution of the voting rights of other persons with the  \nright to vote;  \n\u2022 the potential voting rights of investors, other persons with the right to vote or other persons;  \n\u2022 the rights under other contractual relationships; and  \n\u2022 any additional facts and circumstances that indicate whether the Company has the current ability to conduct relevant \naffairs at the time when such decisions need to be made; this includes details of how votes were cast at previous \nshareholders\u2019 meetings.  \nA subsidiary is either consolidated or deconsolidated from the moment the Company acquires or relinquishes control over \nit. The income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated \nstatement of profit  or loss and other comprehensive income from the date on which the Company acquires control to the \ndate on which it relinquishes control over the subsidiary.  \nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are separated into the part that belongs to the owners \nof the parent company (the Company) and the part that belongs to the owners of non -controlling interests. The total \ncomprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the company and the owners of non -controlling \ninterests, even if this results in a negative balance of non -controlling interests.  \nThe accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with those of the parent company.  \nA subsidiary is defined as a company in which the parent company exercises control. Control is achieved when the parent \ncompany has power over of the entity, exposure, or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and \nthe ability to u se its power over the entity to affect its returns. The company reassesses its control status if there are any \nchanges to the facts and circumstances that indicate a shift in one or more of the three elements of control mentioned \nabove.A subsidiary is defi ned as an entity over which the Company has direct or indirect control. This is achieved by \nacquiring more than 50% of the shares or voting rights, by exercising the right to appoint the majority of members of the \nmanagement or supervisory board, or the ri ght to make decisions in a subsidiary company in such a way that the controlling \ncompany controls the majority of the voting rights in the subsidiary company. In these separate financial statements, \ninvestments in subsidiaries are outlined according to the  cost method.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  \nPlease find below a description of the basic accounting policies that have been adopted.  \n \na) Revenue  \nGenerally,  revenue  is measured on the basis of the compensation determined in the contract with the customer , and is \nrecognized when the control over the goods or services is transferred to the customer . Transfer of control over goods or \nservices can take place continuously (revenue recognition over time) or at a certain date ( point in time  recognition). Prior \nto recognizing income, the Company identifies the contract and performance obligations contained in the contract. The \nnumber of performance obligations  depends on the type of contract and activity.  \n \nRevenue recognition under IFRS 15 for the following sources of revenue  is as follows:  \n \n- Passenger revenue  \nTicket sales are reported as traffic revenue when the transportation service has been provided . The value of tickets \nsold and still valid but not used by the statement of financial position  date is reported as Air traffic liability . This \nitem is reduced either when the Company completes the transportation service or when the passenger requests a \nrefund . Commissions which are payable to the sales agents are recognized as the commercial and marketing \nexpenses at the moment of sale of air transportation documents . Passenger revenue includes revenue from code -\nshare agreements with certain other airlines . Under these agreements the Company sells seats on these airlines\u2019 \nflights and those other airlines sell seats on the Group\u2019s flights . When selling tickets on flights of other carriers, the \nCompany is an agent and recognizes commission income . The revenue from other airlines\u2019 sale on our flights is \nrecorded in the period when the flight is realized  in passenger revenue in the statement of comprehensive income . \n \n- Revenue  from charter and cargo  transport services  \nRevenue from passenger transport services in charter flights and cargo  transport are r ecognized in the period in which the \ntransport services are carried out. Revenue from services is recognized by the degree of completion of the transaction at \nthe reporting date. The degree of completeness is evaluated based on the documentation of the wor k done. Taxes, \ndiscounts and rebates  are excluded from revenue. \n \n- Other sales revenue  \nRevenue from technical service s, i.e. revenue from repairs and maintenance of aircraft, is recognized according to the \ndegree of completion of the project at the reporting date. The degree of completion is determined on the basis of the \nhours worked and planned hours of work required for the particular project.  \n \nRevenues from the provision of education, marketing and other services are recognized in the period in which the \naforementioned services are performed, minus the value added tax, discounts and rebates.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3026, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c1d4411-02d3-48a2-8fa0-74405991e161": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c1d4411-02d3-48a2-8fa0-74405991e161", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2216acf-8ac3-46a4-b1f9-ef0594054e81", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "05361ac84619bd1738838498c4af79cc3d4fa48b4b5d0db6a6e23fc8ba335d44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements (continued)  \nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \n74 \n \n  \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  \n \nb) Interest income  \nInterest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal settled after due date and at the effective interest \nrate applicable . \n \nc) Dividend income and income from share in profit  \nDividend income  and income from share in profit are  recognized  when the right to receive payment is established.  \n \nd) Leases  \nAt inception of a contract, the Group and the Company assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or \ncontains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \nfor consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group and \nthe  Company use the defini tion of a lease in IFRS 16.  \n \nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group and the Company allocate \nthe consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand -alone prices. However, for the \nleases of property the Group and the Company have elected not to separate non -lease components and account for the \nlease and non -lease components as a single lease component.  \n \nThe Group and the Company recognize a right -of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The \nright -of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any \nlease payments m ade at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs \nto dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any \nlease incentives received.  \n \nThe right -of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight -line method from the commencement date to the \nend of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Company by the end of the lease \nterm or the cost of the right -of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right -\nof-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those \nof property and equipm ent. In addition, the right -of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and \nadjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2594, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fa66422-8166-4ca3-b089-323cddf1eb5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fa66422-8166-4ca3-b089-323cddf1eb5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd7c561d-f9ac-41bd-9aab-d8e47eeb61cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "17fc96808e4e85f52a05df16d9438a0243105d678cff3fb9a424a8b04d0eeef5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements (continued)  \nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \n75 \n \n  \n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  \nd) Leases (continued)  \nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \ndate, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group\u2019s and  \nthe Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group and the Company use its incremental borrowing rate as \nthe discount rate.  \n \nThe Group and the Company determine their  incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external \nfinancing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased . \n \nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:  \n\u2022 fixed payments, including in -substance fixed payments;  \n\u2022 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the \ncommencement date;  \n\u2022 amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and  \n\u2022 the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group / the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease  \npayments in an optional renewal period if the Group / the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension \noption, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group / the Company is reasonably certain not \nto terminate early.  \n \nThe lease liability is measured at amortized  cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a \nchange in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the  Groups and the \nCompany\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group and the \nCompany change their  assessment of whether they  will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is \na revised in -substance fixed lease payment . \n \nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right -\nof-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right -of-use asset has been reduced to zero.  \n \nThe Group and the  Company present right -of-use assets and lease liabilities separately in the statement of financial \nposition.  \n \nShort -term leases and leases of low -value assets  \n \nThe Group and the Company h ave elected not to recognize  right -of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low -value \nassets and short -term leases, including IT equipment. The Group and the Company recognize  the lease payments \nassociated with these leases as an expense on a straight -line basis over the lease term.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2849, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e564bda6-0c1b-46e8-91be-b95ab13b0fe3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e564bda6-0c1b-46e8-91be-b95ab13b0fe3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "563a044f-d9c8-48d2-94e5-357bdcee9384", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "ae5ce848c3e2eb49065460fbcd2876417e8b773eb0b2521ced069941a777a814", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements (continued)  \nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \n76 \n \n  \n2.

GOING CONCERN   \n \nIn the period from 2020 -2022, Croatia Airlines operated during the worst crisis in the history of civil aviation, resulting \nfrom the global COVID -19 pandemic that strongly affected all aspects of economic and social activity on a global scale. The \ncrisis h ad a particularly devastating effect on tourism and travels, with airlines and air traffic in general being among the \nmost affected sectors.  \n \nIn 2020, during the most severe period of crisis, Croatia Airlines continued to connect Croatia with the rest of the world, \nand carried on with its mission in 2021 by gradually reintroducing routes and increasing the number of frequencies in line \nwith the demand and the epidemiological measures of individual countries. Following the airline industry trends, it started \nto recover gradually in 2022 in 2023 by increasing frequencies and reintroducing certain routes, but it still failed to reach  \nthe traffic lev els of 2019.  \nIn February 2019, the Government of the Republic of Croatia had reached a decision to initiate the procedure for finding \na strategic partner and to establish a commission to implement the procedure and propose a strategic partner for the \ncompany Croatia Ai rlines. However, the privatisation procedure was suspended due to the outbreak of the COVID -19 crisis, \nand in March 2020 the Commission decided to put it on hold amidst the unfavourable situation and force majeure. The \nGovernment and the Company expect the  process to resume as soon as market conditions allow.  \n \nCroatia Airlines\u2019 business operations in 2023 were exposed to a number of major risks, and maintaining a balance between \nvarious factors and responses to individual risks became more complicated. Fuel and emission allowance prices, and \ninflation, were the main risks affecting Croatia Airlines\u2019 operations in 2023, while a strong increase in sales revenue and a \nstable cash balance level reduced the liquidity risk.  \n \nIn addition to these long -term risks, labour shortage in all segments of air traffic was a great challenge for the airline \nindustry in 2023. Croatia Airlines had sufficient operational transport staff in the summer season of 2023, but the big \nproblems at m ajor European airports caused by the shortage of staff, mainly air traffic controllers, represented a risk for \nthe Company and led to traffic disruptions and related costs, especially in the summer season. The risk was reduced in the \nwinter season due to l ower traffic scope at airports. One of the most significant risks is the escalation of conflicts in the \nMiddle East, as it affects Croatia Airlines\u2019 charter flights between Croatia and Israel.  \n \nDespite a whole array of growing risks, there were significant positive shifts in 2023 compared to 2022, both in terms of \ntraffic growth and financial operations. The Company continuously monitored its liquidity and made cash flow projections \nfor the comin g period in order to timely identify ways to manage potential operational risks related to the settlement of \nits financial liabilities. In May 2023, it repaid the long -term syndicated loan taken with PBZ/HPB, and there was no fresh \nborrowing.

GOING CONCERN (continued)  \n \nAlong with mitigating potential negative impacts of operational risks, Croatia Airlines focused on the further \nimplementation of its Post -COVID Strategy.  \n \nA proposal for Croatia Airlines' Post -COVID Strategy, drawn up in mid -2021 together with the Boston Consulting Group \n(BCG), was adopted in the Company's Supervisory Board session on 31 August 2021, paving the way for further talks with \nthe Republic of Croa tia as the Company owner, and other entities crucial to ensuring a successful and sustainable future \nfor the national flag carrier and Star Alliance member.  \n \nIn addition to increasing its efficiency and competitiveness by transforming its current operating models and methods, the \nCompany faces key operational and structural challenges, including fleet renewal and optimisation of its flight network \nthroughout th e year. Taking into account the trends in the highly competitive Croatian airline market, fuel and CO2 \nemission prices, as well as the EU green policy objectives, there is no alternative to the defined strategic initiatives, and  \ntheir implementation will e nable the Company to seize every opportunity that presents itself, in line with the expected \nrecovery of air traffic. The Post -COVID Strategy represents a new development cycle for the Company, and the \nimplementation of the key strategic initiatives will e nsure sustainable business operations.  \n \nThe implementation of Croatia Airlines\u2019 Post -COVID Strategy started in the final quarter of 2021, following its adoption.  In \nearly October 2022, Croatia Airlines reached a decision to start with a fleet renewal process, i.e. to replace its existing \naircra ft with a new, uniform fleet. With a single -type aircraft fleet, Croatia Airlines will simplify its processes and improve \nits operational and financial performance. It will become even more environmentally friendly, significantly reducing fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions.

After a detailed analysis of the airline market and \naircraft offer, Croatia Airlines opted for A220 type aircraft, with the capacity of 149 (A220 -300) and 127 seats (A220 -100), \nto be delivered in the period from 2024 to 2027.  \nIn early 2023, it entered into an operating lease contract for six Airbus A220 (four A220 -300 and two A220 -100) with Air \nLease Corporation. On 30 October 2023, it finalised arrangements for an operating lease of three Airbus A220 with lessor \nAzzora. In the  second half of December 2023, it arranged for the financing of six A220 with Griffin Global Asset \nManagement. The six aircraft were ordered directly from Airbus, as part of an annex to the contract dating from 2008. The \nfinancing refers to prepayments and  operating lease of the six aircraft. This way it arranged for the procurement of 15 \nAirbus A220 aircraft, as envisaged by the Post -COVID Strategy.  \nA potential delay in delivery of new aircraft and adequate disposal of the five Company -owned Airbus 319/320 upon expiry \nof their service life are seen as two major risks within the fleet replacement process. The decommissioning of the Airbus \nfleet require s a solution to be found while the aircraft are still airworthy, so that their engines, parts and components \ncould be monetised. Selling them in bulk and in \u2018as is\u2019 condition, through sale and leaseback, is seen as the most cost -\neffective option, which imp lies selling them while they are still airworthy and at the same time keeping a lease on them \nuntil they are replaced with new ones. The advantage of this approach is ensuring the flexibility needed when \nimplementing the fleet renewal plan (e.g. extending the lease period in case of delayed deliveries of new aircraft), while \ntransferring the risks related to the disposal of non -airworthy aircraft to the lessor. In September 2023, the Company \neffected the sale and leaseback of the Airbus 319/320, and related  funds will be used for the purchase of spare engines \nfor the A220 fleet. The other aircraft (the Dash 8 -Q400 fleet) will be returned to their owners/lessors upon expiry of the \nlease period.  \n \n2) Optimisation and expansion of the destinations network  \nIn line with the expected recovery of demand for air traffic services upon completion of the pandemic, the Plan envisages \na gradual increase in the number of destinations and frequencies, and optimisation of the expanded destinations network. \nIn 2022, the Company introduced five new international routes from Split Airport: to Amsterdam, Bucharest, Dublin, Milan \nand Stockholm, and increased block time in the winter period by introducing the Osijek -Munich, Split -Zurich, and Pula -\nZurich routes. In 2023, the fo llowing new routes were introduced: Split -Oslo, Split -Skopje, Dubrovnik -Prague, Zagreb -\nMostar, Zadar -Munich, and Bra\u010d -Munich, and the year of 2024 should see the introduction of new routes from Zagreb.  \n \n3) Increase in passenger revenues  \nAn increase in passenger revenues is based on the envisaged rise in the number of transported passengers, while at the \nsame time expanding the offer of services (products) and diversifying their prices, and increasing efficiency through further  \ndigitalisat ion of all commercial activities for the purpose of realising fresh revenue potential.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3827, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6dbfa58-048a-4ef0-ab9f-f5f8b4810a95": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6dbfa58-048a-4ef0-ab9f-f5f8b4810a95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af11f94a-0bf4-4ecc-b0d9-447c873ba4fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "19b0d22bb6c4794e0a1cb4b3de7a2759128a2e07d680f683b785fda13c0ebefa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements (continued)  \nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \n89 \n \n  \n3. GOING CONCERN (continued)  \n \n4) Increase in non -flight revenues  \nThe profiling of the technical sector as a profit centre is underway, with an increase in revenue from maintenance services \nprovided to third parties. The increase is based on the envisaged prolongation of the aircraft maintenance season to nine \nmonths a year, i.e. on the freeing up and maximum utilisation of capacities for third party maintenance once Croatia \nAirlines\u2019 aged fleet is replaced with new aircraft.  \n \n5) Implementation of the Public Service Obligation contract for the 2022 -2026 period  \nCroatia\u2019s traffic connectivity remains in the Company\u2019s focus. Following a public tender, and pursuant to the relevant \ndecision of the Government of the Republic of Croatia, the Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure and Croatia \nAirlines entered  into a contract on the provision of scheduled air transport services in the period from 4 July 2022 to 28 \nMarch 2026.  \n \n6) cost initiatives in the form of reducing different cost categories  \nSome of the planned streamlining measures are optimizing the cost of airport services through the process of negotiating \nwith suppliers, stronger control of existing contracts and search for potential new providers of aircraft reception and \ndeparture in mo nopolistic markets and through negotiating lower prices of airport charges, reducing passenger costs by \nchanging service models. during the flight, rationalization of the sales network or branches, reduction of agency fees. One \nof the cost initiatives is t o reduce labour costs through measures to optimize crew planning and increase the productivity \nof technical staff, commercial and administrative staff by optimizing business processes.  \nDue to growing prices, inflationary pressures and unit price increases announced by suppliers, the effect of these measures \nwere significantly lower than that envisaged by the Post -COVID Strategy, particularly in 2023. In order to further optimise \ncosts by  optimising its business processes, the Company started with digitalisation in the commercial segment, in particular \naircraft maintenance process. The company -wide DMS (Document Management Systems) project is set to begin in 2024 . \n \n7) Negotiations with Airbus with respect to A320neo order cancellation  \nNegotiations on the termination/amendment to the 2008 contract with Airbus Industrie for the procurement of four \nA320neo aircraft started in the autumn of 2019. The negotiations on the Termination Agreement, the subject -matter of \nwhich is the cancellation of the purchase of A320neo aircraft, were put on hold at the onset of the COVID -19 crisis, and \nresumed in early 2021. In 2022, during the negotiations with Airbus on the order of six new A220 aircraft, the parties \nagreed that this order would replace the o rder of A320neo aircraft as part of Croatia Airlines' fleet renewal project and in \nline with the provisions of the Post -COVID Strategy. Therefore, instead of negotiating the termination of the old contract, \nan annex was added to the purchase contract from April 2008, replacing the existing obligations related to A320neo aircraft \nwith a new one, referring to the purchase of six A220 aircraft. The Company also reached an agreement with Airbus on \nthe utilisation of the pre -delivery payments already made for th e new aircraft in the amount of $9 million, as well as on a \nwrite -off of interest worth $1.3 million.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3574, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1edcaecc-e89b-4afc-a11c-7401528cf49c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1edcaecc-e89b-4afc-a11c-7401528cf49c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "340ca1a0-acb1-4c11-8aeb-e9705acf81fd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "bce70fcb0946ef07eafc14e766e1ff30bc131bb3a256980ca44fa69b98286dcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements (continued)  \nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \n90 \n \n  \n3. GOING CONCERN (continued)  \n \nThe global economy will continue to face numerous challenges in 2024, and the fragile profitability of the airline industry \ncould be affected (positively or negatively) by many factors. Nevertheless, IATA believes that there are plenty of reasons \nto be opt imistic about 2024, projecting that it will be the year in which the industry makes a full recovery and reaches the \n2019 traffic figures, i.e. the pre -pandemic level.  \nCroatia Airlines\u2019 ability to achieve the results projected for 2024 will largely depend on the expected demand for air traffi c \nservices. The war in Ukraine, and the Israel -Hamas war, the prices of fuel and other energy products, inflationary pressures \nand supply chain disruptions will be the main risks affecting its performance. From the regulatory aspect, airlines could \nface rising compliance costs and additional costs pertaining to passenger rights regimes, regional environment initiatives, \nand accessibil ity requirements.  \nThe Company's Business Plan for 2024 includes the strategic initiatives outlined in Croatia Airlines' Post -COVID Strategy \nand provides for the intensification of all activities related to the introduction of the first new Airbus A220 aircraft into  the \nfleet.  \n \nCroatia Airlines envisages a profit of EUR 1.4 million for 2024. This result is based on the projection of traffic performanc e, \nwhich serves as a basis for the calculation of operating revenue and expenses. In 2024, the Company will continue to pay \nspecial  attention to maintaining liquidity, and its cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of 2024 is seen to total EUR \n71 million. The planned funds are sufficient to ensure the timely settlement of liabilities in 2024, i.e. to meet the \nprerequisites that will enable the Company to continue operating as a going concern.  \n \nTaking into account all of the above, the Management has come to the conclusion that the Company will be able to meet \nits current liabilities as well as its obligations under the lease contracts in a timely manner.

The amount of PSO  is determined \nas the difference between revenues from certain domestic flights and related direct flight operations expense , and realized  \nas a part of project of maintaining connectivity of regions in domestic airline traffic.   \n \nThe profit from the sale of property, plant and equipment in 2023 included the effect of the implementation of the Sale \nand Leaseback Agreement and is calculated as the difference between the book value of the aircraft and engines and the \ndiscounted value of the assets with the right of use, calculated on the basis of th e total contracted fixed obligations until \nthe end of the lease (according to the rules of IFRS -16). \n \nOther income includes income from approved discounts, other income from previous years, income from cancellation of \nprovisions and other miscellaneous income.  \n \nThe collected value -adjusted receivables from 2022 relate mainly to pre -delivery payments made for the Airbus fleet.  \n \n \n2023 2022 2023 2022\nCroatia Airlines \nGroupCroatia Airlines \nGroupCroatia Airlines \nd.d.Croatia Airlines \nd.d.\nEUR                       EUR                       EUR                       EUR                       \nthousand            thousand            thousand            thousand            \nIncome from PSO 15,558                   14,782                   15,558                   14,782                   \nGain from sale of property, plant and equipment 9,490                     52                           9,490                     52                           \nBad debts collected 2                             9,335                     2                             9,332                     \nIncome from sale of spare parts 10                           19                           10                           19                           \nOther income 4,342                     4,257                     4,317                     4,195                     \n29,402                   28,445                   29,377                   28,380", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2381, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92e45ef7-66ac-4a75-800e-fac6674ba368": {"__data__": {"id_": "92e45ef7-66ac-4a75-800e-fac6674ba368", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a3f9c977-8c63-40b3-9412-6af53121f277", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projekti\\llama_index_chatbot_starter\\data\\CA\\annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2306689, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "1c941d1068185390a1c5373674d93cd17b0ed2662b6c4257984bd0fdb6bd0aa7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements (continued)  \nFor the year ended 31 December 2023 \n93 \n \n  \n7.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)  \n \nUntil September 2023, the Company owned five Airbus aircraft nearing the end of their service life. As adequate disposal \nof the five Airbus 319/320 upon expiry of their service life was seen as a major risk, the fleet replacement process included  \ntheir sal e and leaseback in September 2023. The decommissioning of the Airbus fleet requires a solution to be found while \nthe aircraft are still airworthy, so that their engines, parts and components could be monetised. Selling them in bulk and in  \n\u2018as is\u2019 condition , through sale and leaseback, is seen as the most cost -effective option, which implies selling them while \nthey are still airworthy and at the same time keeping a lease on them until they are replaced with new ones. The \nadvantage of this approach is ensurin g the flexibility needed when implementing the fleet renewal plan (e.g. extending the \nlease period in case of delayed deliveries of new aircraft), while transferring the risks related to the disposal of non -\nairworthy aircraft to the lessor.

This risks includes market risk, credit risk and \nliquidity risk.

If market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using \ndiscounted cash flow models or other appropriate pricing techniques.

For this reason, the estimated \nfair value cannot  be obtained from the sale of a financial instrument at this point.  \n \nValuation techniques and assumptions in determining the fair value  \nWhen calculating the fair value the Company takes into account the rules of IFRS fair value hierarchy that reflects the \nsignificance of inputs used in the valuation process. Each instrument is individually assessed in detail. The levels of the f air \nvalue h ierarchy is determined based on the lowest level and input data which are important for determining the fair value \nof the instrument.  \n \nFinancial instruments  that are measured at fair value are categorized into three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy, as \nfollows:  \n1. First level indicators - fair value measurements indicators are those derived from the (unadjusted) prices in active \nmarkets for identical assets and liabilities  \n2. Second level indicators - fair value measurements indicators are inputs other than quoted market prices included \nwithin Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability (their prices), either indirectly derived from prices) and  \n3.

In case that the interest rate was higher by 0.5%, in relation to \ncurrent market interest rate, the effect of EUR 3 thousand  would debit income statement (2022: EUR 1 thousand) and, \ncontrary, in case that the interest rate was lower by 0.5% the effect of EUR 1 thousand would credit income statement for \nthe period ended 31 December 202 3 (2022: EUR 1 thousand).  \n \nForeign exchange risk  \nThe Group and the Company are exposed to the transaction risk, which is the risk of the commercial cash flows being \nadversely affected by a change in exchange rates for foreign currencies against EUR; and statement of financial position risk \n\u2013 the risk of net monetary assets in foreign currencies acquiring a lower value when translated into EUR as a result of \ncurrency movements.  \nThe Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s principal foreign exchange risk is the long -term loans as described  in Notes 30 and 3 1, which \nare largely  denominated in Euro s and US Dollars .

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  \n \nFor all other payment relationships, the Group and the Company evaluate the solvency and payment history of cust omers \nand control  exposure to any one customer by credit limits, which are periodically reviewed to determine if they are still \nappropriate . Where there are factors, which indicate that a customer may not be able to repay all or part of a receivable the \nGroup and the Company make appropriate allowances to reduce the carrying value of the receivable to their  recoverable \namount . The credit risk from investments and derivative financial instruments arises from the danger of non -payment by a \ncontractual partner .

The market price \nof jet fuel has been extremely volatile in recent years .  \n \nIn case that the fuel price was higher by 5% in relation to current market price, the effect of EUR 2,545 thousand would debit \nprofit and loss account and, contrary, in case that the fuel price was lower by 5% the effect of EUR 2,545 thousand, would \ncredit profit and loss account for the year 202 3 (2022: EUR 2,760 thousand).  \n \nLiquidity risk  \nLiquidity risk is the risk that an enterprise will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet its commitments as they come \ndue. The Group and the Company manage  liquidity risk by monitoring on a regular basis their  maturing commitments, and \nby maintaining appropriate amounts of cash on hand and in deposits, to cover unexpected fluctuations . \n \n \n39.1 Liquidity risk tables  \n \nThe following table details the Company\u2019s expected maturity for its non -derivative financial assets and liabilities for the years \nended 31 December 20 23 and 20 22.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE  \n \nThe Company intensified activities related to the introduction of the first new A220 aircraft into the fleet, in line with th e \ninitiatives set out in Croatia Airlines\u2019 Post -COVID Strategy. The first new A220 is expected to be delivered in mid -2024, \nmarking  the start of the fleet renewal with new state -of-the-art aircraft in the 100 -150 seat market segment. According to \nthe manufacturer, the Airbus A220 features new -generation engines that reduce noise by 50% per seat, consume 25% less \nfuel, emit 50% less CO 2 and 40% less NOx (nitrogen oxides). Naturally, passengers can expect a more comfortable journey. \nIn addition to flying on new and quieter aircraft, they will get to enjoy other in -flight benefits, such as Internet access, USB \nA and USB C ports at every se at and a more comfortable cabin.  \nIn the first quarter of 2024, Croatia Airlines  flew to 13 international and seven domestic destinations. Having operated 5,272 \nflights, it recorded a block time of 6,900 block hours, or 3% more in terms of both flights and block hours compared to the \nsame period of 2023. A total of 321,936 passengers w ere carried, or 6% more compared to the first quarter of 2023. While \npassenger kilometres rose by 6%, the passenger load factor (PLF) was 59.7%, 1.6 pp lower than in the first three months of \n2023. The number of passengers transported in domestic scheduled  traffic rose by 9%, and of those carried in international \nscheduled traffic by 6% over the same period of 2023.  \nBased on its summer flight schedule, the Company plans to connect Croatia directly to 28 international destinations, i.e. 29 \nEuropean airports, with its aircraft operating on 50 international routes. It is significantly expanding its network of \ninternation al flights from Zagreb and Split by introducing new direct routes: Zagreb - Tirana, Zagreb - Berlin, Zagreb - \nStockholm and Split - Istanbul.  \nMore than 17,200 flights are planned, offering nearly two million seats, which is about 6% more in peak season.
